            <div>Database Developer | Pollinate | Portland, OR</div>
                <p>
                    As a Database Developer, transitioning to software engineering within the company, I assist with software development projects for clients like Carhartt and Life is Good, as well as maintaining their databases.  I am responsible for making data that's human readable to get output to the front-end.
                    I currently manipulate the data behind 100+ Under Armour garments per month, as well as help out with the data for JBL speakers, Astro Headsets, and Bauer Hockey equipment, among others.

                    As a Database Developer Intern, I got to learn the interrelations of all of Pollinate's databases, expand my SQL knowledge, and help with the data behind building out Under Armour garments.
